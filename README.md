This project is composed by 7 APIs. The first two are just for testing (root aplication) and greetting. 
The four that follow them are for consulting currency quote: all of the available currencies, a specific one, a specific one for a period of 30 days, 
and a plot of the fluctuation during these 30 days.
Lastly, we have an API that should consult the weather forecast for the next 5 fives for Brasilia, capital of Brazil.
