This project is composed by 7 APIs. The first two are just for testing (root aplication) and greetting. 
The four that follow them are for consulting currency quote: all of the available currencies, a specific one, a specific one for a period of 30 days, 
and a plot of the fluctuation during these 30 days.
Lastly, we have an API that consults the weather forecast for the next 5 days for Brasilia, capital of Brazil.

To run any of these applications, all you have to do is go to the test_main.http file, get the disered url and put on a browser. 

And here you can find a postman collection with the weather forecast API, with a response as example:
[Forecast.postman_collection.json](https://github.com/RenataLReis/fastApiProject/files/13653925/Forecast.postman_collection.json)
